    <p class="first-paragraph">In this page I will talk a little bit about myself as well as my life.
        I am a 25 year old male who is a husband & became a father to a beautiful baby boy on
        <strong>February 13th 2022</strong>. I have always been interested in technology since the very beginning
        of my life as I was fascinated with how it works and how we are all dependent on it on a daily basis. 
        Altough I began programming on the side such us on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> and on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">Youtube</a>, I quickly realized that I wanted a more structured program
        to learn more material and become ready for my first job in technology. This is why I enrolled in <a href="https://flatironschool.com/" target="blank">FlatIron School</a> and I'm excited
        to begin in the March co-hort!
    </p>
    <p
        class="second-paragraph">During my early years as a child I had grown up in private schools where I was always
        fascinated by technology and knew that this is what I wanted to pursue when I grew older.
        As the years went on and I eventually graduated from highschool, I enrolled in a computer science program at the local
        county college. I found it initially very difficult because we were consistently taught theory instead of actually coding,
        which deterred me away from programming and I started to switch to a more financial / analytical major. I also at this time
        found my first professional career as a universal banker at the age of 20 at a large financial firm. 
    </p>
    <p
        class="third-paragraph">As the time went on I was working a lot and bounced around ideas on what I wanted to do in my life as 
        I did not have any clear cut direction and still wanted to grow professionally of course. I was taking part time college classes
        while working 40 hours a week which did not give me much leg room to do anything else. Regardless I decided to try to study for the finra licences 
        because the next logical step in my career was to be an investment banker. As I studied and tried to put my head down and focus I realized 
        I wanted something more and did not want to pursue this as my next career. I was still puzzled on what I wanted to do but, continued to grow in my current role
        and become a top seller in my market. I further took my skill-sets and joined the largest financial firm in the US as a <strong><em>Relationship Manager</em></strong>.
