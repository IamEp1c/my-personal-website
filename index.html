    <p class="first-paragraph">In this page I will talk a little bit about myself as well as my life.
        I am a 25 year old male who is a husband & became a father to a beautiful baby boy on
        february 13th 2022. I have always been interested in technology since the very beginning
        of my life as I was fascinated with how it works and how we are all dependent on it on a daily basis. 
        Altough I began programming on the side such us on codecademy and on youtube, I quickly realized that I wanted a more structured program
        to learn more material and become ready for my first job in technology. This is why I enrolled in Flat Iron School and I'm excited
        to begin in the March co-hort!

        class="second-paragraph">During my early years as a child I had grown up in private schools up until 8th grade,
        where my love for technology grew and I knew that this was something that I wanted to pursure as I got older. 
        As the years went on and I eventually graduated from highschool, I enrolled in a computer science program at the local
        county college. I found it initially very difficult because we were consistently taught theory instead of actually coding,
        which deterred me away from programming and I started to switch to a more financial / analytical major. I also at this time
        found my first professional career as a universal banker at a large financial firm.
